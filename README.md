# Madagao
This is my git for everything related to the game project "Madagao"

I am creating a game from scratch in unity to further advance my programming skills and everything that I will do will be posted here.

Type of game: Hack and Slash RPG (look up the game "Lost Ark" if you are interested in knowing more about the style of the game)

Right now this will be only a demo that will show most of the mechanics in the game.
